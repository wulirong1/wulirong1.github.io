                I'll touch that fire for you<br />
                I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
                I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
                I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
                Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
                Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
                Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
                I don't got nobody, just with you right now
                Tell the truth, I look better under you
                I can't lose when I'm with you
                How can I snooze and miss the moment?
                You just too important
                Nobody do body like you do
                I can't lose when I'm with you
                I can't just snooze and miss the moment
                You just too important
                Nobody do body like you do, you do
                In the droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
                Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (main one)
                Let's take this argument back up to my place
                Sex remind you, I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one
                We ain't had shit, yeah, it was magic, yeah
                Smash and grab shit, yeah
                Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
                Ain't a home when you not here
                Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'
                I can't lose when I'm with you
                How can I snooze and miss the moment?
                You just too important
                Nobody do body like you do
                I can't lose when I'm with you
                How can I snooze and miss the moment?
                You just too important
                Nobody do body like you do, you do
                Main one ridin'
                How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
                How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
                How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?
                Just tryna be your everything
                Main one ridin'
                How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
                How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
